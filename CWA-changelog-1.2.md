![Cover Enforcement CWA](cwa-enforcer-diagram.png "CWA 1.2.0 Cover Enforcement Diagram")

  - Something that's always bothered my as a Kindle user has been Calibre-Web's inability to change the Metadata and Covers stored within the `.epub` files of our books, despite letting us change these things in the Web UI
  - This has resulted in many people, including my self, running instances of both `Calibre-Web` **AND** full-fat `Calibre`, to make use of `Calibre`'s much more robust editing tools to change out those ugly covers and keep our Kindle Libraries looking **_~ a e s t h e t i c ~_**
  - Well, **_no more!_**
  - Using `CWA 1.2.0`, whenever you change any **Covers** or **Metadata** using the `Calibre-Web` UI, those changes will now be automatically applied directly to the `.epub` files in your library, as well as in the Web UI itself, meaning that from now on what you see really is what you get!

- ## **One Step Full Library Conversion** - Any format -> `.epub` ‚úèÔ∏è
  - Calibre-Web Automated has always been designed with `.epub` libraries in mind due to many factors, the chief among which being the fact they are **Compatible with the Widest Range oif Devices**, **Ubiquitous** and **Easy to Manage and Work with**
  - Previously this meant that anyone with `non-epub` ebooks in their existing Calibre Libraries were unable to take advantage of all of `Calibre-Web Automator`'s features reliably
  - So new to Version 1.2.0 is the ability for those users to quickly and easily convert their existing Ebook Libraries, no matter the size, to `.epub Version 3` format using a one step CLI Command from within the CWA Container
  - This utility gives the user the option to either keep a copy of the original of all converted files in `/config/original-library` or to trust the process and have CWA simply convert and replace those files (not recommended)
  - Full Usage details can be found in the `Usage` Section of the CWA GitHub page

- ## **Simple CLI Tools** for manual fixes, conversions, enforcements, history viewing ect. üë®‚Äçüíª
  - On top of the existing automatic ingest folder feature, you now also have the ability to manually ingest books from the command-line using the following built-in command:
    - `convert-library --keep/-k`  OR `--replace/-r`
  - Built-in command-line tools now also exist for:
    - Viewing the Edit History of your Library files _(detailed above)_
    - Listing all of the books currently in your Library with their current Books IDs
    - **Manually enforcing the covers & metadata for ALL BOOKS** in your library using the `cover-enforcer -all` command from within the container **(RECOMMENDED WITH FIRST TIME USE)**
    - Manually Enforcing the Covers & Metadata for any individual books by using the following command
    - `cover-enforcer --dir <path-to-folder-containing-the-books-epub-here>`
  - Full usage and documentation for all new CLI Commands can be found unde the `Usage` section of the project's GitHub page.

- ## **Easy to View Change Database and Internal Automatic Logging** üìà

![Cover Enforcement CWA](cwa-db-diagram.png "CWA 1.2.0 Cover Enforcement Diagram")

- In combination with the **new Cover & Metadata Enforcement Features**, a database now exists to keep track of any and all enforcements both for peace of mind and to make checking for any bugs or weird behavior easier, but also for statistics of whatever someone might want to use the data for
- Full documentation can be found under the `Usage` section of the project's GitHub page.

# New and Simplified Installation Methods
- ## **Now Fully installable through Docker Compose using our Latest DockerHub Image!** üêãüéâüôå

- ## Updated Script Installer (Alternative Install Method) üë®‚Äçüíª
  - Due to updates to Calibre-Web, the script installer needs to be run within the included `calibre-web-base-image`, newer versions of Calibre-Web are currently **INCOMPATIBLE** with Calibre-Web Automated.
  - Script install method edited to support the new `1.2.0 features` and simplified to make the installation as easy as possible
  - The Installer will now automatically detect any books in your Library that are not in `.epub` format and will give the user the option to run the new Library Conversion Process during setup
  - Full documentation on this install method can be found under the `Installation` section of the projects GitHub page.
### Bugfixes
- Fixed a few potential crashes during the Script Install process
- Fixed errors that could occur during the import of books with non-english characters in the title or author's name ect.
- Fixed an error that could occur when many new books were placed into the ingest folder at once
- Overall speed and reliability improvements

### Future Development
- I've now been daily driving this version of Calibre-Web Automated (_formerly Calibre-Web Automator_) for a couple weeks now and it now does everything I need for my reading workflow, I personally love the new features and hope you do to!
- I will continue to maintain this project but as to new features I'm very much open to requests so please reach out with any suggestions or ideas you might have and I'll do my best to implement them!
